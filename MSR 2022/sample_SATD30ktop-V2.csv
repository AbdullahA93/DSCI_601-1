analysis.

This DFA can be modified trivially to check for all
unused variables (just maintain a global set of variables that
must be used, adding them as you go, and on each AlgoState::use,
remove the var from this set). This would work even without variable
usage pre-resolution (which in 7.0 is not implemented yet and
maybe won't be).

Since we have the reaching definitions at each variable usage, we
could also use that to detect other kinds of bug, eg conditions
